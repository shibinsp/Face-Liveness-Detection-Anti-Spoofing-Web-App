2. **Queue Management** - Buffered frames (max 2)
3. **Detection** - Process every Nth frame (configurable)
4. **Rendering** - Display with bounding boxes
5. **Logging** - Periodic saves to CSV

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "No module named 'insightface'"
**Solution:** Use `app_enhanced.py` or install Visual C++ Build Tools

### Webcam not detected
**Solution:** 
- Check webcam permissions
- Try different camera index in code
- Restart browser

### Low FPS in continuous mode
**Solution:**
- Increase `detection_interval` in code
- Enable GPU acceleration (app.py)
- Close other applications

### CSV file locked
**Solution:**
- Close CSV file if open in Excel
- Use "Download Log" button instead

## 🎨 Customization

### Adjust Detection Frequency
```python
detection_interval = 5  # Process every 5th frame
```

### Change Liveness Threshold
```python
liveness_threshold = 0.5  # Adjust between 0.0 - 1.0
```

### Modify Video Resolution
```python
cap.set(cv2.CAP_PROP_FRAME_WIDTH, 1280)
cap.set(cv2.CAP_PROP_FRAME_HEIGHT, 720)
```
